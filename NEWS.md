# wdiEF 1.0.3

## Changes in version 1.0.3

- Fixed an issue where the package would crash if the raster FVC had no values equal to 1.
- The function now ensures that FVC values are properly handled to avoid computational errors.

---
This update improves the robustness of the package for cases where the full range of FVC values is not present.
